Flickrwl is an anonymous Flickr images crawler written in Python, that lets you
batch download images of a specific user, tag of search result. Data parsing is
based on Regex matching on raw HTML.

Even though there is avaiable Flickr APIs to do this more easily, I tend to do
the alternative hacking on HTML code.


Sample Usage:

  python FlickrCrawler.py user ziliangdotme

  python FlickrCrawler.py tag Sydney

  python FlickeCrawler.py search Lady Gaga
